# Dealer's Den Info Coming Soon!

# After Hours

Please note that once the Dealers Den and Night Market are closed for the evening, nobody will be allowed inside. As a general rule, even staff are not allowed inside the rooms after hours; the only exception would be a Dealers Den lead and only then if they are accompanied by a member of our Security team. Please double and triple check to make sure that you have all of your personal belongings with you when you leave; items such as personal ID, money, phones, etc. that you might need should not be left in the Den or Night Market overnight.

# Code of Conduct

Please review our [Dealer Code of Conduct](/dealers-vend-policy)

Note that the above is an extension of our primary [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct).

# Need Help?

Please contact [dealers@fursquared.com](<mailto: dealers@fursquared.com>) with any questions, comments, or concerns. We will do our best to respond in a timely manner.
