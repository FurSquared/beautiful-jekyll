### Please remember to check out at the info desk when you leave the alley for the day!

This way, people on the waiting list can participate AND you get the opportunity to sign up for the next day’s lotto immediately! **Failure to check out may result in disqualification for the following day.**

## How to Participate:

### Option 1: On-Site Lotto Signups

* Sign up in-person before the lotto draw times (see time table above). This is done at the Artist Alley Info Desk, right outside of the Artist Alley. You can be added to the waitlist any time throughout the day.
* The Lotto will run when the Alley opens for Setup (see time table above).
* If your name is chosen in the lotto, you get 1 hour to set up. If you haven’t checked in and claimed your table before the Artist Alley opens to the public, you have a 15 minute grace period to do so before your spot is forfeited and given to the next person on the waitlist.
* Waitlisted people will be contacted via Text/Telegram when a spot opens up.

### Option 2: Telegram Lotto Signups

* Go to the Artist Alley Telegram Announcement Channel \[Link will be available Wednesday 2/21/24 ]
* Find the pinned message titled “LOTTO SIGN UP”
* Comment with your Badge Name, Badge Number, and all days that you would like to enter the lotto (Friday, Saturday, and/or Sunday).
* That’s it! The list of lotto winners and waitlist will be posted in the channel each morning.
* If you would like to add/remove days that you are signed up for, just reply to your original comment with the changes and tag @renacat before the next lotto pull.

**Info we’ll need from you:**

* Badge Name
* Badge Number
* Telegram @ or Phone Number

### Rules and Other Info

* **Do not post things on walls.** This is a historical hotel with historical walls, please be respectful. **If this rule broken, you will be immediately removed from the Artist Alley and disallowed from entering the lotto for the rest of the weekend.** Depending on severity, your badge may be revoked completely.
* **Please clean your area for the next person when you check out.**
* **Each person gets ½ of a table.** Please don’t encroach into your neighbor’s space.
* **Cover those bits: Minors will be present at the con, so please have NSFW pieces clearly marked and censored.**
* **If you’re away from your table for more than 30 minutes, your spot will be forfeited to the next person on the waiting list.** Some exceptions may apply - come talk to us at the desk if you’ll be away for a while. You’re not a prisoner, but we want to make sure that the small space can cater to as many artists as possible over the weekend, and abandoned tables are discouraging to both commissioners and those on the waitlist.
* **There will be no access to electrical outlets.** Having a portable power bank is highly recommended.
* **A communal laminator will be set up at the Info desk.** Lamination sheets will be provided for a $1 donation to the charity, or you can bring your own.
* **Please use headphones if you’d like to listen to music.**
* **Keep displays at a reasonable height - about 2 standard gridwall cubes \[14x14 inches] high.** 
* **Don’t starve yourself, but please keep food and drinks off the tables to protect yours and others’ artwork!** Open drink cups without lids are not ideal.
* **All artwork for sale or on display should be created by you.**
* **AI art is not allowed.**
* **Please keep premade, large “merch” \[clothing, fursuit parts/props, bags, pillows, etc] to a minimum.**
  *The general guideline is that you should be able to work on what you’re selling at your table \[generally, drawings]. Small, supplemental items \[stickers, keychains, etc.] are allowed, but should not be the main focus. There are of course exceptions to the rule \[i.e. if you’re drawing on t-shirts at your table and finishing them at the con, then selling clothing would be allowed].*

If you have questions about whether or not your items fall in the guidelines, please email **art@fursquared.com** before the con or find **RenaCat** or other Artist Alley Staff in-person by the **Artist Alley Info Desk** or via the **Artist Alley Telegram Channel**.

This year, most of our at-con announcements will be made through telegram! Go to [ **Link will be available Wednesday 2/21/24** ] to keep yourself updated!

Be Kind. Have Fun. Make Bank.\
Good Luck!
