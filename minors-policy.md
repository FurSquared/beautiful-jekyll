# **FurSquared Minor Attendance Policy**

---

FurSquared is committed to providing a fun, welcoming, and safe environment for all attendees, including minors. To ensure the safety and well-being of minors attending the event, the following policy is in place:

## **Access to the convention space for Minors**

All minor badges (and anyone under the age of 18\) will be denied access to the following areas of the convention space, including, but not limited to;

* 18+ panels  
  * Night Market

* #### **Minors aged 13 years old and under**

  In addition to the above limitations, Minors 13 and under must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian, that is at least 18 years old, at all times while attending our convention. Security will be notified if any minors are found unaccompanied.

  In addition, we have made available a special badge for Minors 13 and under called a Kid-in-Tow badge (KIT). (See “[Kid-in-Tow, and Parent-in-Tow Badges](#kid-in-tow-and-parent-in-tow-badges)” below)

* #### **Minors aged 14 \- 17 years old**

  Minors, aged 14 and up, may roam the convention freely, however they must submit a parent/guardian consent form to registration at time of badge pickup. (Listed in the [next section](#consent-requirement-for-minors-14---17-years-old).)

  Should any parents/guardians wish to chaperone their minor(s) while they enjoy the convention, there is a special badge that you can request just for this. (See “[Kid-in-Tow, and Parent-in-Tow Badges](#kid-in-tow-and-parent-in-tow-badges)” below)

### **Consent Requirement for Minors 14 \- 17 years old** {#consent-requirement-for-minors-14---17-years-old}

Any attendee under the age of 18, but is at least 14, at time of registration, must submit a properly completed, signed, and notarized, consent form at the registration desk before receiving their badge. We cannot, and will not, release a badge to a minor until either, they present the correctly filled-out consent form or their parent/guardian is present.

\*Consent forms can be found on FurSquared’s registration page (or right [HERE](https://static.fursquared.com/documents/f2-2025-consent-form.pdf)).

* **If the minor is registering/attending alone**, they must present a consent form that has been signed by their parent or guardian, and legally notarized.

  To be considered properly complete, the form must:

  * Be printed off from the FurSquared site. (Available [HERE](https://static.fursquared.com/documents/f2-2025-consent-form.pdf))

  * Completed and signed by the parent or legal guardian over the age of 18\.

  * Have a notary stamp with a raised seal.

  \*Finding a Notary around your area can be found [here](https://www.asnnotary.org/?form=locator) ([asnnotary.org](https://www.asnnotary.org/?form=locator)) or by searching “notary near me”. You can also check with your local public offices and libraries as they often have free or low cost notary services.

* **If the minor is accompanied by a parent/guardian over the age of 18 during the registration process,** the guardian can sign the consent form in-person and we can release the badge to the minor at that time.

  \*These will be available upon request at the registration desk during the convention.

### **Kid-in-Tow and Parent-in-Tow Badges** {#kid-in-tow-and-parent-in-tow-badges}

When you check in at the registration desk, you will be given the opportunity to request a Kid-in-Tow (KIT) OR a Parent-in-tow (PIT) badge alongside any paid, attendee or higher level badge. These special badges are a courtesy to allow someone who is attending FurSquared to bring up to 2 (two) Minors 13 and under (in the case of the KIT), or up to 2 (two) Parent/Guardians over 18 (in the case of PIT) with them into convention space. A custom name on the KIT or PIT badge can even be added just like a regular attendee badge. However, there are some limitations to these badges.

* UP to 2 (two) KIT Badges, OR 2 (two) PIT badges, allowed per each 1 (one) Paid attendee or higher level badge.

* At least 1 (one) attendee tier, or higher, badge must be purchased in order to request any KIT or PIT Badges

* KIT and PIT badges, act similarly to minor badges and therefore do not grant access to the following spaces:

  * 18+ panels

  * Night Market

  * Charity Auction

* #### **Kid-in-Tow badge for Minors, 13 years old and younger at time of registration.**

  * This badge can be given to minors that are accompanied by a guardian (18 years old or older), who has purchased an attending level, or higher, badge.

  * Minors 13 and under must be accompanied by a parent/guardian, that is at least 18 years old, at all times while attending our convention. Security will be notified if any minors are found unaccompanied.

  * The Parent or Guardian of the minor must purchase a badge, under their name\*, in order to receive a KIT badge for their minor. 

    Click [HERE](https://static.fursquared.com/documents/f2-2025-register-minor.pdf) for step by step instructions on how to register a Minor aged 13 or younger.

  \*In order to stay within compliance with Wisconsin privacy laws, any information submitted for registration for the paid badge must belong to the attending parent/guardian(s). Do not include information of someone 13 years old, or under, when registering online as we cannot, and will not, keep records of any information belonging to minors 13 and under. Any registration found to be made with information belonging to someone that is age 13 or younger will be deleted on site and the guardian/parent, aged 18 or older, will have to register themselves.

* #### **Minors, 14-17 years old at time of registration:**

  * Minors, between the ages of 14-17, do not fall into the category of either Kid-in-Tow or Parent-in-Tow and must register independently. Though they will still need to submit a consent form, [as described above](#consent-requirement-for-minors-14---17-years-old), in order to receive their badge.

  * Parents or guardians who wish to accompany their minor, can request a Parent-in-Tow badge, listed below.

* #### **Parent-in-Tow Badge for Parents/Guardians of Minors 14-17 years old at time of registration:**

  * The Parent-in-Tow (“PIT”) badge is intended for parents/guardians that are just attending as a chaperone to walk along with their minor(s) as they enjoy the con space.

  * There must be at least 1 (one) paid, attending, or higher tier, badge purchased to request a PIT Badge.

  * PIT badges, act similarly to minor badges and therefore do not grant access to the following spaces:

    * 18+ panels

    * Night Market

    * Charity Auction

  * Click [HERE](https://static.fursquared.com/documents/f2-2025-register-guardian.pdf) for steps on how to register the attendee if a PIT badge is needed.

* #### **Family Groups Exceeding Two Parents/Guardians**

  For families wishing to bring more than two parents or guardians, or any other additional attendees must contact us in advance to discuss a possible exception\*.

  Email us at [registration@fursquared.com](mailto:registration@fursquared.com)

  \*Exceptions are made on a case-by-case basis and there are no guarantees that any exceptions or allowances can be made.

### **Guardians and Caregivers**

For those accompanying someone to the convention as a Caregiver and required to be with them at all times, we offer our Caregiver Badge. The Caregiver Badge allows someone to bring along 1 (one) person, as their Caregiver, to accompany them as they enjoy the con space.

* There must be at least 1 (one) paid, attending, or higher tier, badge purchased to request a Caregiver Badge.  
* Only 1 (one) Caregiver Badge allowed per Attendee  
* Caregiver Badges allow access to almost all of the same spaces that the Attendee’s badge allows, however, the Caregiver must be with the Attendee in order to access the space themselves. (Unfortunately, at this time, this access does NOT include the Sponsor Dinner, if applicable)  
* Caregiver Badges Do NOT grant access to any perks, swag, sponsor dinner, or any other extra features of being a Sponsor, or Super Sponsor, even if the Attendee has purchased the highest tier badge offered.  
  * The only exception is access to Con Suite and front-of-line or early-entry access to panels or spaces, if offered at the event AND the paid attendee is Sponsor or higher tier.  
    * Should the person(s) with the Caregiver Badge wish to attend sponsor dinner or receive any other perks, they must upgrade their free badge. A request should be made by emailing [registration@fursquared.com](mailto:registration@fursquared.com) after registering the Attendee, but before arriving at the convention, to ensure availability of upgrade spots for the attending Caregiver/Guardian. There are NO guarantees of availability of upgrades on site/once the convention has started.
