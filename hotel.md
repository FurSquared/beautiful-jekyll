# Hilton Milwaukee City Center

The Hilton Milwaukee City Center, originally opened in 1928 as the Milwaukee Schroeder Hotel, is a historic hotel that is hosting our convention this year! Developed by Walter Schroeder, it was one of the largest and most luxurious hotels in the Midwest. It faced economic challenges during the Great Depression and World War II but remained a significant landmark. Acquired by Hilton in 1972 and renamed, it has since undergone renovations to combine its lavish historic elegance with modern amenities, continuing to be a prominent downtown Milwaukee attraction. The hotel is located in the heart of downtown Milwaukee, just a few blocks from the Milwaukee River and Lake Michigan, and is surrounded by a variety of dining, shopping, and entertainment options.
