## How do I collect Sales Tax?

You have the option of either adding tax to the advertised prices of your goods, or including tax in the price of your goods. If you include tax in the price of your goods, you must either:

- Provide the customer with a receipt which separately itemizes the tax or states “Prices Include Sales Tax.” or
- Conspicuously posting a sign which states “Prices Include Sales Tax.”

## How do I file a return?

https://tap.revenue.wi.gov/mta/_/

When you applied for a Seller’s Permit in Wisconsin, you would have also been assigned a filing or reporting frequency. (Monthly, Quarterly, or Annually)

If you qualify for the Occasional Sales Exemption, you should not have an active Seller’s Permit for the duration of the event. If you qualify for the exemption, but have an active Seller’s Permit, you’re still liable for paying WI sales tax.

As long as you have an active Seller’s Permit in the State of Wisconsin:

- A return MUST be filed for each reporting period even if no tax is due.
- If you are an out-of-state vendor, you may want to inactivate your Seller’s Permit, if you won’t have additional sales in Wisconsin for the remainder of the year.    
**This is not legal or financial advice, please review WI DOR Publication 201 for more information.**
- Inactivating your Seller’s Permit will not require you to submit a return.
