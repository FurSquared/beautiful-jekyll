Greetings FurSquared Family,

We’re very excited to announce that we are now accepting Dealers Den and Night Market applications! We also have some amazing new changes for both the Dealers Den and Night Market this year!

Our Tech Team has been hard at work developing a brand new system for applications that has replaced the Google Forms one. Along with several backend improvements, the new system includes an application tracker so you can view the status of your application and track the process. It also provides applicants with a way to ask questions and receive a response within the application!

One of our biggest changes is that Dealers Den and Night Market will now be located inside the Convention Center that is connected to the hotel! This allows us to provide a much larger space, bigger tables and host more Dealers!    

Lastly, for the first time ever at FurSquared we will have a permanent Night Market within the Dealers Den space! 

I can’t even begin to express how excited I am to be at FurSquared this year and I look forward to seeing everyone there!

Apply to vend at FurSquared at <https://vendors.fursquared.com>.

Linx Wolf    
Dealers Den Director
