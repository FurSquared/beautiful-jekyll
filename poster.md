</div>

Poster tier for FurSquared 2025 will be **first-come, first-serve**. There are **50 slots** available for the poster tier, and once 50 people have signed up for the Poster tier and paid for the tier in full, FurSquared will announce on both this webpage and social media (X, Telegram, etc.) that all slots have been filled.

If you found yourself already registered for FurSquared 2025 but did not select “Poster” as your registration level, you can still upgrade your registration tier to Poster! Within your registration confirmation email, there should be a link to edit your registration and upgrade to the Poster tier. Note that you will need to pay the difference between Poster and your current level in order to secure your spot on our poster.

If you are not able to register for the Poster tier either as a new registration or as an upgrade, that is because all registration slots for the Poster tier have been filled.

One final note regarding Poster registration: After the closing date for Poster registration (November 1st, 2024), **no refunds will be given to Poster level attendees**. For more details on the refund process, please see our [refund policy](https://fursquared.com/registration/).

If you have any further questions about our poster this year please reach out to [poster@fursquared.com](mailto:poster@fursquared.com).

# Information Required for the Poster Tier
To participate in FurSquared's 2025 poster, we need several details about the character to be drawn:

- Character name
- Description

Please share links to references, censoring is okay. Do not use discord links. Google Drive links should be fine as long as they have permissions for anyone to view. Imgur might work too. We have limited time and cannot wait for emails to go back and forth, so please have links prepared for your character.

Also, when you submit references for your character, please make sure they are safe for work (SFW) and contain no explicit content. If you do not have references of your character that are SFW, you may give us NSFW references as long as the explicit / mature content is censored.

If a suitable reference is not submitted, then your registration level will be downgraded to Super Sponsor and you will be refunded the difference.

For help and/or clarification on these requirements, please contact [registration@fursquared.com](mailto:registration@fursquared.com).
